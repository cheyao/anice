# Icedev & Anice

*"FPGAs work like this. You don't tell them what to do, you tell them what to BE."*

An FPGA is a chip that can be configured on the hardware level. You can basically make your own CPU and GPU on it.

This project is composed of a PCB duo, that will be later joined together:

The first PCB called "icedev" is a ICE40 FPGA development board:
- 16MHz clock
- 64KiB eeprom
- 128MiB flash
- 1.2MiB of RAM
- dual usb-c
- multi voltage
It's equivalent is like the raspberry pico (orph pico)

The second, called "anice":
- 256MiB of ram
- 128MiB of flash
- HDMI port
- triple USB C with JTAG converter
- SDCard Reader
- dual 25MHz clock and 200MHz built-in clock
- multiple indicator lights
- only 4 layer PCB

The repo stucture is a bit messy because I wanted the two designs to appear together on kicanvas.
